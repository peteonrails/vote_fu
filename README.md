## Installation

Add to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'vote_fu', '~> 2.0'
```

Run the installer:

```bash
rails generate vote_fu:install
rails db:migrate
```

## Quick Start

### Set up your models

```ruby
# app/models/post.rb
class Post < ApplicationRecord
  acts_as_voteable
end

# app/models/user.rb
class User < ApplicationRecord
  acts_as_voter
end
```

### Cast votes

```ruby
user.upvote(post)           # +1 vote
user.downvote(post)         # -1 vote
user.vote_on(post, value: 5) # 5-star rating
user.unvote(post)           # Remove vote
user.toggle_vote(post)      # Toggle on/off
```

### Query votes

```ruby
# On voteables
post.votes_for              # Upvote count
post.votes_against          # Downvote count
post.plusminus              # Net score
post.wilson_score           # Ranking score (0.0-1.0)
post.voted_by?(user)        # Did user vote?

# On voters
user.voted_on?(post)        # Did user vote?
user.vote_value_for(post)   # What value?
user.voted_items(Post)      # All posts user voted on
```

### Rank items

```ruby
Post.by_votes               # Order by vote total
Post.by_wilson_score        # Order by Wilson Score
Post.trending               # Most votes in 24h
Post.with_positive_score    # Net positive only
```

## Scoped Voting

Allow multiple independent votes per item:

```ruby
# User can vote separately on quality and helpfulness
user.vote_on(review, value: 5, scope: :quality)
user.vote_on(review, value: 1, scope: :helpfulness)

review.plusminus(scope: :quality)      # => 5
review.plusminus(scope: :helpfulness)  # => 1
```

## Karma

Calculate user reputation:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :posts

  acts_as_voter
  has_karma :posts, as: :author
end

user.karma  # Sum of upvotes on user's posts
```

## Counter Caches

Add columns for performance:

```ruby
# Migration
add_column :posts, :votes_count, :integer, default: 0
add_column :posts, :votes_total, :integer, default: 0
add_column :posts, :upvotes_count, :integer, default: 0
add_column :posts, :downvotes_count, :integer, default: 0
```

Counters update automatically when `counter_cache: true` (default).

## Ranking Algorithms

### Wilson Score
Best for quality ranking. Accounts for statistical confidence.
```ruby
post.wilson_score(confidence: 0.95)
```

### Reddit Hot
Balances popularity with recency.
```ruby
post.hot_score(gravity: 1.8)
```

### Hacker News
Heavily favors recent content.
```ruby
VoteFu::Algorithms::HackerNews.call(post, gravity: 1.8)
```

## Configuration

```ruby
# config/initializers/vote_fu.rb
VoteFu.configure do |config|
  config.allow_recast = true           # Change votes?
  config.allow_duplicate_votes = false # Multiple votes per user?
  config.allow_self_vote = false       # Vote on yourself?
  config.counter_cache = true          # Auto-update counters?
  config.turbo_broadcasts = true       # Turbo Stream broadcasts?
  config.default_ranking = :wilson_score
  config.hot_ranking_gravity = 1.8
end
```
